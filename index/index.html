            Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming
            language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
            use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as
            its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
            logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is
            dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
            programming paradigms, including structured (particularly,
            procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often
            described as a "batteries included" language due to its
            comprehensive standard library.

            C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create
            high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne
            Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers
            a high level of control over system resources and memory. C++ is one
            of the world's most popular programming languages.C++ can be found
            in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and
            embedded systems.C++ is an object-oriented programming language
            which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be
            reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used
            to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

            The domain name net is a generic top-level domain (gTLD) used in the
            Domain Name System of the Internet. The name is derived from the
            word network, indicating it was originally intended for
            organizations involved in networking technologies, such as Internet
            service providers and other infrastructure companies. However, there
            are no official restrictions and the domain is now a general-purpose
            namespace. It is still popular with network operators and the
            advertising sector,[1] and it is often treated as an alternative to

            PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter
            implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface
            (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and
            executed PHP code which may be any type of data, such as generated
            HTML or binary image data would form the whole or part of an HTTP
            response. Various web template systems, web content management
            systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to
            orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response.
            Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the
            web context

            (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. C#
            was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was
            later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in
            2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along
            with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were
            closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products.

            Perl is a family of two high-level, general-purpose, interpreted,
            dynamic programming languages. "Perl" refers to Perl 5, but from
            2000 to 2019 it also referred to its redesigned "sister language",
            Perl 6, before the latter's name was officially changed to Raku in
            October 2019. Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are
            various backronyms in use, including "Practical Extraction and
            Reporting Language". Perl was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a
            general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing
            easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions.

            Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose
            programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to
            interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's
            standard library depends on the Java Class Library,but type
            inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly
            targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend
            web applications using React) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for
            native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps.
